gnome-shell-extension-ubuntu-dock (0.2) artful; urgency=medium

  * Add Replaces temporarly against gnome-shell-extension-dashtodock package
    which ships the same schema on purpose. This unblock users for the week-end
    until we decide on the best strategy to keep the schema synced and not
    diverge (should we conflicts and let people prefers installing dash to dock
    from the online extensions website local to their users, not being affected
    by our overridesâ€¦ or have a separate binary package, common to both, and
    thus diverge the dash to dock package from debian?)
